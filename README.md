# burger-crawler-front

My capstone idea is to make a website that will let users plan out a pub crawl, but instead of drinking, the theme is burgers. Users will be able to choose a crawl route based on the area that they live in, or will be traveling to. Restaurants will build profiles that will display their location and menu. 

Once the website is logged in on localhost:3000, a customer/user can create a profile by pressing the Sign up button (left button in the top right corner)

This will take you to a sign up page where you can enter your login details

Once submitted, you will have to use the link localhost:3000/customerProfile/17 to see your customer profile. This is where a user will choose the burgers that they want to eat on their crawl.



On the restaurant side, you can use localhost:3000/restaurantProfile/3 to see a restaurant profile. There is a burger submit form that will allow restaurants to upload new burgers to that will be displayed on the users end.
